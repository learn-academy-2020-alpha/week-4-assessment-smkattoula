# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.  

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: An instance variable can be accessed by any method of a class, whereas other variables can only be accessed by one method.

  Researched answer: A local variable that is defined inside one method, for example, cannot be accessed by another method. In order to get around this limitation, we can use instance variables inside our Ruby classes. An instance variable is a variable that is accessible in any instance method in a particular instance of a class.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A way to group elements together.

  Researched answer: A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call; the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list). The code in the block is not executed at the time it is encountered.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Not sure :(

  Researched answer: Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method. ... But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: object-oriented programming allows you to store data in objects whereas functional programming does not allow you to do this.

  Researched answer: Functional Programming and Object-oriented programming both are different concepts of programming language. ... In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class can hold an object within it. An object is a state that stores values.

  Researched answer: The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects. ... An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.
